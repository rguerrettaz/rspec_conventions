Rspec Conventions
========================

This repo has been created with the intent of documenting how to write great Specs in Rails using Rspec.

I find specs easy to write in general, but writing them well is tough, often because a lack of knowledge or experience. Hopefully the examples contained within will help to overcome the first hurdle (knowledge). Once we've the knowledge it's up to us gain the experience, commiting what we've learned to memory. Hope this helps. :)
