Rspec Conventions
========================

This repo has been created with the intent of documenting how to write great Specs in Rails using Rspec.

This doc came about out of my own frustration writing crappy spec.

I find specs easy to write in general, but writing them well is tough. Often it's tough because a lack of knowledge or experience. Hopefully the examples contained within will help you to overcome the first hurdle (knowledge). Once we have the knowledge its up to us to put this knowledge to work and commit it to memory. That's the fun part. Hope this helps. :)
